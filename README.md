ETS2MP Localization
===================

ETS2MP php files that contains translations to many languages. You can contibute your own language.

When my localization will be added to website?
===================
As soon as possible - I don't have time to check github everyminute and update all localizations real time. 

How to translate?
===================

1. Create new file caller {language}.php for example: dutch.php
2. Translate all messages to your langauge keep this format:
```
 $_lang[key] = "message";
```


Remember: Do not change key. Change only "message".
